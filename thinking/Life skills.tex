\section{Introduction}
Active learning of life skills prevents creating and prolonging problems. A skill = repetition + knowledge + experiment.
- steps are
	- extract lessons from recent mistakes and solutions
	- read, note related statements and questions, answer them
	- Simplifie and memorize one note to apply knowledge faster.
- mistakes are
	- no separation of concerns 
	- impatience
	- execution escapism
	- experimenting based learning too early
Examples of life skills (maybe all?)
- Quitting addictions
- self caring
- Reducing spendings
- Getting a D
- Getting a job
- Building TSL
- Problem solving, preventing, analyzing, prioritizing
Reminder from ChatGpt
- improvement = execution x reviewing x researching

My question is how does researching (improvement) help
- preventing problems
- solving problems
	- faster
	- efficientlier
- analyzing problems
The answer (mine)
- Researching and memorizing reduces the effort of brainstorming which reduces DTSBF
- Prevents taking too much time in execution and ineffective execution
- prepares you for new problems (some people just know career or family, importance of not experimenting with drugs, )
- If you read about other people suffering and their regrets you might start making wise decisions and be more responsible.
- Makes analyze problems better (rcat, 5w) and understand priorities better
\section{Types of tasks}
To solve most of your problems
- Maintenance tasks are recurrent to prevent reappearing problems.
- Waterfall tasks are to be finished once to change your situational problems.
- Learning tasks allow you to prevent creating and prolonging problems
- Reviewing allow you to solve problems
