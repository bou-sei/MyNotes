\section{Introduction}
This activity was founded by the fear of committing to a one-year degree and not getting a job after.
This research should allow me to
\begin{itemize}
    \item Save meta reminders and answer meta questions
    \item Extract a TSL plan based on real market numbers
    \item I think there are transferable technical skills
    \item I think that they are more important to learn
    \item Identify the cv accomplishments of recent hires
    \item Identify the strengths of people who get promoted
    \item Keep track of the demand’s evolution of skills and jobs
\end{itemize}
\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aren’t the goals of this document/activity too much?
    \item Isn’t there a better decomposition of goals?
    \item Shouldn’t this activity be decomposed into reports since it’s a lifelong need?
    \item Can this activity be decomposed to recurrent tasks or system of inputs / outputs?
    \item What should I do now? 
\end{itemize}
