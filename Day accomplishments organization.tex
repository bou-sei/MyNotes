\section{Introduction}
I made recently the decision that my dw goal is a certain amount of time. I forgot why I changed back to minimal tasks per dw category. I forget why i have minimal progression goal per category. I feel that it's not working anymore. I forgot what other alternatives of DAA i have. Why has DAA moved to electronic format? If true, does every current DAA maintain a solution and prevent a recurring problem? What skill is this? Can i decompose it?
\section{Imported notes}
- Never go shopping if it's not planned
- Day Planning is a maintenance task; it prevents overdoing one task and neglecting others
- Never do a day plan not based on top of quarterly refuses because it's the only start to prevent DTSBF
- other steps are to add refuse drink coffee (it effects you 24h), refuse salt it gives you nocturia, r eat none planned items (low glucids, low lipids, low prep, low cost)
- a preplanned tasks of deep work don't allow me get back where i stopped if i get interrupted or if i get ajob
Never delete this. Refactor it if you want but never delete.
Daily Aiming for  minimums accomplishments per category of tasks allows you to
\begin{itemize}
    \item have a foundation for anything you do even if u don't do anything
    \item prevent problems cumulation in a life domains
    \item have a resume point when you get interrupted
\end{itemize}
- Usable categories of DAA minis are
- Self care
- RAHP
- problems prev and solving
- Career building
- exp and admin expad
- after minis for when time allows it.
