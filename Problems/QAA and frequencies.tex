\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
QAA are accomplishment to finish every four hours. They are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item any self care task
    \item a quantity of deep work
    \item the remaining are RAHP
\end{itemize}
Frequency based tasks are a list of tasks to do according when counter is up. The task becomes red when it has been too long since last done.
\section{advantages of the system}
QAA allowed me to combine self care, rahp and deep work in one list. Frequency based deep work tasks allowed me to prioritize learning technical skills then job search skills then admin then thinking. It also allowed me to group different types of activities per goal and link goals to each other.
\section{exit reasons}
I failed to rotate self care. i failed to take advantage of available deep work time when the block allow it.
I exited frequency based tasks because it did not allow me to have logical finishes.
\section{reasons for regret}
\begin{itemize}
    \item forgetting the real reasons
    \item made me maybe having unclear thoughts
    \item i don't really know
    \item i know that i am not following any system now.
\end{itemize}
