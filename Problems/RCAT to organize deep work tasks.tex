\title{How to get back to updating RCATs}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
    I decided that the most important problem is returning to work according to RCAT. because no one will tell what i need to do. But i should watch out from two things:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item time orientation tasks instead of logical finishes.
        \item thinking branch forgetting.
        \item There was i think the following unsolved problem: if my final goal is to deep work 12h/day, is it healthy, is it possible, most importantly, why my day goals are different from the trunc problem. (trunc problem has root causes). If my day goal is crossing at least one accomplishment per category of daily tasks. why is nt this the trunc problem.
    \end{itemize}
    This is not a problem. This The problem is the symptoms and consequences of working without 3 liner RCAT branches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loss feeling: i don't know what i want and what i need to do to get there.
        \item No priortizing of deepest causes solving on top of other tasks.
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Conlusion of returning to RCAT} deep work 10h/day is one aimed accomplishment among others. Its failure is the problem. Maybe my measurable goal changed to 2h/q which i failed. I have other problems not just failing daily aimed accomplishements like : job search tasks are inefficient. i don't have technical skills. i have dtsbf. I still catch new sicknesses. I have domestic violance. I can't move out. 
Linking them might be good. But i can solve problems without linking everything. Also i trying to solve everything might be the definition of too many goals. Okay this analysis must be separated for later revision.
\section{After conclusion opinion}
This is an example of recreating my organization from scratch. Concidentally, i was interrupted before recreating my organization. How can i minimally change my organization in order to have recurrent tasks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does my problem becomes that my job search tasks don't have the same importance?
    \item I have another problem. what the fuck am i doing? I don't want to think indefinitly and time based?
    \item This is a better problem. I am spending time writing thoughts with no finish aim. i will spend the whole if say if i start with thinking activity.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a number of updated thinking documents.
        \item a number of finished problems analysis. A problem analysis is a document.
        \item a number of goals changes? this don't guarantee clarity improving.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{decision}
Firslty, updating a number of documents is important since it improves my understanding of the subjects. This can be done by creating a repository and watching number of updates. Secondly, I should stop reading long formats since day goal depends on time based finishes.
So, i need to install github for my notes. Secondly, i need a pipeline for readings. Thirdly, i need to update my thinking goals.
\begin{itemize}
    \item won't the number of updates cause to seek smallest improvement to increase number of documents?
\end{itemize}
