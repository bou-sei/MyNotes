    \item Okay. i did minimum per category of daily accomplishments. But now i don't know what to do?
    \item Should i go write a problem report?

    \item i think i should solve a problem since i have problems even with problems priortizing, knowledge building, life project, urgency of finding a job and building my resume.
    \item what is most important problem or set of problems?

        \item Absent problem selection thoughts records
        \item Urgency of getting a job
        \item important Returning to work according to rcat
        \item failure to solve any problem
        \item unrecorded decision taking?
        \item bad system of organizing writings?
        \item no simple to complex skills navigation
        \item too hard to finish simplest recurring tasks.
        \item still in word list of problems
        \item maybe before choosing a problem i should read a set of previous notes in order to bring the intuition (aka urgency feeling) of priorities
