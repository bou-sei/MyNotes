\begin{itemize}
    \item I feel that i am wasting my time on learning latex and fine tuning the process.
    \item Isn't there something else more important to be done?
\item I ditched minimum per category and I don't know why i ditched it and i don't remember why I used it.
\item i even ditched working on my problems list
\item why can't finish any small important accomplishment. the cause is that i am stuck on what i am doing now. i am stuck because i don't have a logical finish. what am i trying to finish?
\item what can i finish in job search? i can only send a resume. I want to work on practising interviews but i get stuck. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item there are no steps for practising an interview \textrightarrow solved i think
    \item i did not solve the mental model of improvement focused interviewing repetition.
\end{itemize}
\item I feel and i am lost again.
\end{itemize}
