\begin{enumerate}
    \item I failed to create a todolist
    \item I decided that i need to stop what i am doing because it's not working
    \item I figured out that i am thinking too much 
    \item I figured out that i am working and wanting too many goals and trying to solve too many problems.
    \item I decided that i needed max 5 goals
    \item inside of each one put some doable tasks.
\end{enumerate}
What happened to figure out this ? The overfullness of suffering and wondering
Is it the absent step of searching for symptoms .
