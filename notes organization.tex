\section{Related problems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I use many apps: word, obsidian, and now texstudio
	\item word lacks files navigation, osidian lacks formatting, texStudio might reveal other problems
\end{itemize}
\section{Facts}
Since a skill is mastering the execution of a type of tasks using continuous learning, active practice and repetition, knowledge should be grouped according to plannable blocks of time, aka tasks.
You should write for each problem an analysis article. It allows you a high level of thoughts clarity, and leaving a consultable record of the logic of decisions.
\section{Latex}
Why am i using latex? I am spending too much time configuring it, instead of learning actual skills.
\begin{itemize}
	\item I need an editor that allow me to open notes folder parallely. I could have just opened file explorer parallely to word.
	\item I needed better formatting than obsidian. I could have just used Word.
	\item I needed to zoom in zoom out while working on the document. Word does this.
	\item decomposition of one pdf project into multiple notes files like this \textbackslash input\{ conclusion.tex\}. why do i need this. If i remember it this might be useful \textrightarrow skills hierarchy decomposition principle.
\end{itemize}
