\section{Addictions}
An addiction is a practice or a consumption that a person can't stop despite harms. My personal definition is a harmful pleasure. At first, it starts a pleasure but it usually transforms into a pseudo need in a way that is painful to resist and hard to stop. The problem with quitting addictions is they don't have  afinish time like actions and accomplishments and tasks. therefore in order to quit addiction, you need to divide your day tinto four hours and consider every sober slot a separate accomplishment. Watching series is bad because among others it makes you think of them instead of your current task. I regret that ate unauthorized foods. I am brainfogged again.
